				<p>
					My name is Benjamin Fields and I am a graduate student
					at Oregon State University located in Corvallis, Oregon. I am 25 years old and originally from Boise, Idaho. I came to the state of Oregon to complete
					my Bachelors in Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering. After completing my undergrad I knew that I wanted to continue my education and pursue 
					a graduate degree, which brings me to where I am today. 
				</p>

				<p>
					I am in my second year of my masters  
					pursuing a M.S. in Industrial Engineering focusing on information systems with a minor in Computer Science. I am advised by
					<a target=# href="http://mime.oregonstate.edu/people/porter" >Dr. David Porter</a> and co-advised by 
					<a target=# href="http://eecs.oregonstate.edu/people/zhang-eugene" >Dr. Eugene Zhang</a>. 
					My Research is focused on data driven approaches and algorithms to automatically discover process simulation models 
					in the context of manufacturing assembly systems. 
				</p>

				<p>
					I have become fascinated by the overlap of Computer Science and Industrial Engineering
					and hope to continue my studies in a professional setting in the years to come. 
					I am also very interested in the use of
					computer graphics in an engineering setting for applictions such as CAD, process simulation, mechanical analysis and other related problems. On a less
					technical note, I love the outdoors, rock climbing, music, hockey and programming. Thanks for stopping by and feel free to reach out if you have any
					questions.

			<p>
				Aside from all the technical experience and education let me share a little about myself. I am 25 years old and from Boise, Idaho and came to Corvallis, Oregon in 2010 to begin
				 my college career. I have since completed my B.S. and started in on a M.S. which I am in my second year. I am studying Industrial Engineering and Computer Science and
				 have become captivated by the combination. I truly enjoy programming and the process of solving a wide range of problems. I have a particular interest in Computer Graphics 
				 applications in the engineering domain and hope I can find myself in this problem space professionally, but thats not all. Let me share a little bit more about who I am. 
			</p>
			<div class="lable">Hockey:</div>
			<p>
				I love playing most sports but the one that has been the most important in my life has been hockey. 
				I have been on skates since I could walk and started playing hockey soon after. I played all through grade 
				school and high school and continue to play recreationally when I get the opportunity as there is no rink in Corvallis.
				 I would probably have
				to say that my favorite NHL teams are the Pittsburgh Penguins and the Colorado Avalanche.  
			</p>
			<div class="lable">Climbing:</div>
			<p>
				<div id="climbing">
				<img src="resources/img/IMG_0265.JPG" width=250 height=300>
				<p> 
				I love climbing. I started climbing at a very young age and have since climbed all over the West. Sport climbing, 
				trad climbing, bouldering, you name it I enjoy all of it. Climbing has actually played a recreational and professional role
				 in my life as I was a climbing instructor for Oregon State for a few years. I hope to continue to climb for many years to come. 
				 My favorite place to climb is in Leavenworth, Washington. In the image on the left you can see me chalking up while bouldering in Leavenworth.

					<img src="resources/img/guitar.jpg" width=350 height=250>
					<p>
						Music has been a part of my life since I was a kid. I started in music on the violin in orchestra, which was soon followed by
						 the guitar and the piano after that. I find both the creation and science of music fascinating. There are so 
						 many languages in the world, but no matter where someone is music is always understood. You can see an image of me playing guitar 
						 with my brother's band at an informal gig at the mountaineering museum in Golden, CO.

			<div class="lable">Outdoors:</div>
			<img src="resources/img/sawtooths.jpg" width=100% height=auto>
			<p>
				Nature is truly amazing and luckily I am in the Northwest, which has some of the greatest scenery in the country in my opinion. I try to get out and enjoy it as much as possible 
				doing things such as backpacking, fishing, white water rafting, snow sports, camping, running, or really anything outside. While technology is great, I think it's important to 
				look away from the screen every now and then to enjoy the best engineering we know...Nature. The image above is from Imogene Lake in the Sawtooth Mountains located in central Idaho.   
			</p>
			<div class="lable">Programming:</div>
			<p>
				I have come to truly enjoy computer programming and the process of thinking through a problem and systematically creating a solution.
				 You can often find me reading text books on various topics in computer science trying to learn as much as I can. I think CS will play a 
				 very important role in the years to come and knowing how these technologies work will be crucial. It is already starting to change how we 
				 live our lives on a daily basis. While my grandparents may have walked miles to school over mountains and through snow, I will likely have to tell my
				  grand children how I had to MANUALLY drive my own car to school and MANUALLY shift the gears. How ancient :)
